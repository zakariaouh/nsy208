/**
 * The <code>Regsub</code> class provides an iterator-like object to
 * extract the matched and unmatched portions of a string with respect to
 * a given regular expression.
 * <p>
 * After each match is found, the portions of the string already
 * checked are not searched again -- searching for the next match will
 * begin at the character just after where the last match ended.
 * <p>
 * Here is an example of using Regsub to replace all "%XX" sequences in
 * a string with the ASCII character represented by the hex digits "XX":
 * <pre>
 * public static void
 * main(String[] args)
 *     throws Exception
 * {
 *     Regexp re = new Regexp("%[a-fA-F0-9][a-fA-F0-9]");
 *     Regsub rs = new Regsub(re, args[0]);
 *
 *     StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
 *
 *     while (rs.nextMatch()) {
 *         sb.append(rs.skipped());
 *
 *         String match = rs.matched();
 *
 *         int hi = Character.digit(match.charAt(1), 16);
 *         int lo = Character.digit(match.charAt(2), 16);
 *         sb.append((char) ((hi &lt;&lt; 4) | lo));
 *     }
 *     sb.append(rs.rest());
 *
 *     System.out.println(sb);
 * }
 * </pre>
